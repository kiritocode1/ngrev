always prefer to use PNPM for this project , for installation , building and deployement, avoid npm at all costs. 

for one of scripts , like testing etc , use bun ... 

prefer to write stuff in typescript for one off scripts . 

example usecases : pnpm install <package>

bun example usecase : bun run someOneOffTestingScript.ts
